# myTouchSmart Switch Documentation

Jasco manufactures Internet of Thing (Iot) devices under the myTouchSmart. Some of these devices are sold under GE's branding, such as this [WiFi Smart Light Dimmer](https://www.amazon.com/myTouchSmart-40794-Assistant-Neutral-Required/dp/B07SZHD9GF?th=1).

These devices depend upon Jasco's (currently) free web service for control of the IoT devices and for integration with populat digital assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Home. But what if Jasco's services go down?

This repository seeks to document how Jasco's APIs work with the goal of eventually building an alternative API or service that can replace Jasco's, enabling end users to operate without dependence on external systems.
